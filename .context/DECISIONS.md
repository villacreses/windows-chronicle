# Major Decisions

## WinUI 3

Reason:

Native Windows experience.

Alternatives considered:

- Electron
- Avalonia
- WPF

Decision:

WinUI 3.

---

## Provider-Neutral Architecture

Reason:

The product should not inherit UX decisions from Google or Microsoft.

Chronicle owns the experience.

Providers supply data.

---

## Build Provider-Agnostic Features First

Reason:

Most complexity lies in calendar UX.

Integrations should become mapping problems rather than product-design problems.

Current strategy:

1. Solve local calendar experience.
2. Solve calendar management.
3. Solve views and recurrence.
4. Add providers.

---

## UTC Storage

Reason:

Interoperability and synchronization.

Tradeoff:

Local-time conversion required at UI boundaries.

---

## Avoid Premature MVVM

Current complexity does not justify a framework migration.

Rapid iteration is prioritized.

This decision may be revisited later.

---

## MainWindow Decomposition into Helper Classes

Reason:

MainWindow.xaml.cs had grown into a dumping ground for state, calendar grid
rendering, sidebar rendering, and dialog construction, making it hard to
reason about.

Decision:

Extract cohesive rendering/dialog responsibilities into small focused
classes (`CalendarGridRenderer`, `SidebarRenderer`, `EventDialogService`,
plus `DateHelpers`/`ColorHelper`), instantiated directly by MainWindow.
MainWindow remains a coordinator: state ownership, event handlers, and
refresh orchestration.

No new architectural pattern (MVVM, DI, event bus) was introduced, in
keeping with "Avoid Premature MVVM." Behavior and repository usage are
unchanged.
